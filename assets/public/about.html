      <p>My name is Abosede Mary Oluwakemi, a graduate of Information Technology from the University of Medical Sciences, 
        Ondo State, Nigeria. I am the fourth child of the family of seven. I am an upcoming Front-end developer. Funny enough, 
        I picked an interest in web development out of curiousity at first, and to be very honest I find it very interesting and 
        thrilling. I love the fact that it is challenging as I get to learn different programming languages along the line such as, 
        HTML, CSS and a little of Javascript . I started by going through an offline version of W3school to start writing code and 
        I was enlightened by a friend who happened to be a software developer.
      </p>

      <p>I heard about Techpye from a friend when she sent the link to me so I could register in order to expand my knowledge
        in Tech, in which I applied and did not expect that I would be accepted for the training. Here I am, doing what I love 
        doing best. Well, aside coding, I love reading stories, watching food vlogs, cooking, singing and staying in my room. Boring right?, 
        I think that is all you need to know about Mary!
